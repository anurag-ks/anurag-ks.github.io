This is just a Welcome/test post. I just shifted my blog/website to jekyll. I guess I just keep coming back to this
beautiful static site generator. It's 4:10 am in the morning and I have classes to attend but jekyll has just excited me up. Jekyll, the name is taken from the classic literature of "Jekyll and Hyde". A case of split-personality, that's what that story is all about. Surprisingly there is another static site generator named `Hyde` as well. The awesome Jekyll's evil twin. Check it out over <a href="http://hyde.github.io/">here</a>

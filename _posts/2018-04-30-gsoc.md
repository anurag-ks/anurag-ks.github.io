Recently I got accepted into the Google Summer of Code program. Basically, in this
program students get an opportunity to work with Open Source organizations from all
around the world and complete a software project. The work spans for almost 3 months,
for which we get paid a very good amount inform of a stipend. (for India its 2400$ USD)

Tell me what is more cooler and awesome than Google funding your summer project, I'll wait.

One thing that makes this whole thing more cooler is that I got accepted in my first year.
If you are from Manipal, you would know how pathetic the coding culture is over here. As far
as I know, for the 2018 GSoC only two students were able to qualify. I might go ahead and start
ranting about the lacklustre attitude most of the students have towards knowledge and creativity,
but I'll leave that for another post.

As for my GSoC project, I will be working for OpenWISP, you can learn more about them on their [website][0]

And you can learn more about my project over here - [Project][1]

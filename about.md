This is my personal website where I randomly rant about things happening in
the world or in my life. I am an engineering student who loves to code and
develop software. I am not a professional writer or have interest in becoming
one, so please ignore my grammatical errors, if there are any on this website.

I am a 19 year old undergraduate, currently doing my Bachelors in Engineering in
MIT, Manipal, India. I have a passion/love for programming and developing
softwares since my school days(9th grade to be specific). At a school level, I
started contributing to the open source world and Google Code In helped me a
lot in this. I took part in two editions of ​ Google Code In 2013-14 and ​ 2014-15​ ,
during which I contributed to ​ Sahana Software Foundation​ . I specifically
worked on Sahana Eden which was a “disaster management system” web
application written in Web2Py and with the help of some wonderful mentors I
managed to become a ​ Grand Prize Winner two times(could have gone again
but then the rules changed).

Apart from GCI, I have made several personal projects, one of them was an
online judging system. A basic django application to compile, execute and test
computer programs on a django server. It was used in my school during a
competitive programming event.

As of May 2018, I am working under OpenWISP organization for my Google Summer of
2018 project.
